<!SLIDE>
# So, nils? What's the story?

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# A 'historically bad decision' #
* The "null reference"

  * invented by Tony Hoare in 1965
  * part of the type system for ALGOL W

* A "billion dollar mistake"?
  * count up all the `undefined method 'foo' on NilClass` errors you've ever got
  * multiply that by all the programmers in the world
  * count that number back to 1965

# Third Slide

* Sometimes bullet items
  * Have sublists
  * And some sublist items
    * Have some of their own
    * And so on
* But top-level "bullet items" have no bullets
  * isn't that odd?

Also, sometimes you just want to have plain text sitting in the middle
of the screen. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
